    <p>Hey,</p>
    <p>In our in-person bootcamps, I often encourage students to practice the skills they've acquired. Because after all
        it's practice that turns a beginner into a master.</p>
    <p>So why no try your hand at some of these optional front-end challenges and get more practice with HTML and CSS?

    <p>*This is a resource that some students found helpful, the challenges are optional. I'm not affiliated with the
